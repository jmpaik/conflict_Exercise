This exercise is making me all hot and bothered.


# Carol and Bob are better than Ted and Alice

Bob and Carol are pair programming on Carol's computer, ok..

Ted and Alice are working on their sections right now. Ted likes to refer to himself in the third person when he's writing in an 'md' file. He doesn't think it's weird and neither should you.

I AMMM THE GIMP!!
This is craziness, yo.
I don't like playin this game.

To make this even more confusing Bob is now Carol which makes Carol hot and bothered too.


I am in the master branch more typos.
